## Learning GraphQL
I will use docker to run php-8 server.
In project i want to use React with typescript and
UI will be written in sass, tailwind and headless(probably)

i have done 
- server API by graphQL
- some front UI by tailwind and react
- apollo client
- couple of queries and matations by apollo
- only works login form without route guards and a lot of verifications (because it test project)
